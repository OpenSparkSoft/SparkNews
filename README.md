#SparkNews

Welcome to SparkNews project, this project aims to provide an open source platform for anyone
who wishes to create a news account/profile/channel.

This project is community driven and aims to counter the increasingly filtered news that is currently happening around the world.
A website where no news gets filtered.

The project as of now, is only in its initial state and future plans are being devised. If you wish to be part of this project, do not hesitate to contact us. 
Thank you.

## 1. Goals

The project has many goals to accomplish. We wish to provide a platform where any user can create an account to either read and rate articles, 
and/or to create content. This project is funded entirely by the people who support their content creators and through donations.

It is debatable to whether or not publicity will be accepted on the website. If so, it will be in a controlled state 
and will have no influence on its content creators or site management.

Content creators can have followers and subscribors (monthly subscription)

Content is rated according to different categories, to be determined.
